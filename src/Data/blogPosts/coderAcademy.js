    <h2>Why I Signed Up</h2>
    <p>After nearly a decade in law and construction, I needed a change. Something more flexible. Something intellectually sharp. Something different.</p>
    <p>I’d already explored career paths in law and construction management. Both had their rewards, but I started looking for something that offered more flexibility, creativity, and long-term adaptability. What really tipped the scales? Watching a friend navigate grief and family from the other side of the world while still working. That kind of flexibility just doesn’t exist in law or construction.</p>
    <p>I talk more about the "why" in my <a href="/blog/career-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">career switch blog</a>, but the short version is this: I wanted control over how and where I worked. I needed more autonomy, more learning, and a better balance.</p>
    <p>I’d already dabbled in Harvard’s CS50 and quickly realised software engineering might be the leap I was looking for. It felt like the right mix of problem-solving and creativity. Coder Academy offered a structured path into the field, with a diploma that actually meant something. I enrolled with a plan, a full-time job, and just enough confidence to believe I could juggle both.</p>

    <h2>The Course</h2>
    <p>I studied at the Academy of Interactive Technology (trading as Coder Academy Australia), graduating with a Diploma of Information Technology. The course ran full-time over 10 to 12 months, starting in October 2023 and finishing with a 3-month internship at Go Driving.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Term 1: HTML, CSS, Git, Markdown, Python, basic computer science</li>
      <li>Term 2: Python, SQL, databases, logic, algorithms</li>
      <li>Term 3: JavaScript, the MERN stack, and a final full-stack project</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each week included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Classes on Tuesday and Thursday: 7 to 9pm</li>
      <li>Class on Saturday: 9am to 1:30pm</li>
      <li>Plus another 13 hours of self-study on paper, anyway.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reality vs Expectation</h2>
    <p>In theory, I was going to work full-time and study part-time. Then switch gears and study full-time near the end. I’d already done CS50, so I thought I had a head start. I’d network early. Keep my social life. Maybe even keep my sleep.</p>
    <p>In practice? Not quite.</p>
    <p>I ended up studying at least two hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Saturday after class I usually relaxed, but still got two to four hours of study in (minimum). Sunday was a full on study day four hours in the morning, then back into it until I’d cleared the week. And that was just the usual rhythm it didn’t include the extra time I spent catching up, debugging, or getting through assignment-heavy weeks.</p>
    <p>Once I switched to part-time work (Monday and Tuesday in the office), my total study time didn’t really change, but I gained some breathing room. I wasn’t constantly on edge anymore.</p>
    <p>I needed every one of those 13-plus hours, and then some. It was just enough to keep up with lessons, but not enough for coding challenges or project work. Burnout hit fast, and the only thing that kept me going was structure and volume.</p>

    <h2>Rules I Had to Make to Survive</h2>
    <p>I built strict boundaries. I stuck to a sleep routine. Every night, same bedtime. I always gave myself ten minutes to wind down. Without that, my brain wouldn’t switch off.</p>
    <p>If I couldn’t fix a bug within an hour, I walked away. Not just to sleep sometimes I just needed space. I solved more problems on walks and in the shower than I ever did staring at a screen.</p>
    <p>If I had less than an hour left in the day, I didn’t start new code. No late night puzzles.</p>
    <p>I studied from a plan, not a feeling. Each study block had a goal. I built these around the marking criteria, which helped me get good grades. But in hindsight, that focus came at the cost of deeper learning. I was there to learn to code, not just tick boxes.</p>
    <p>I asked questions but only later in the course. Early on, I stayed silent because I didn’t want to sound stupid. I regret that now.</p>

    <h2>Life Adjustments I Made</h2>
    <p>A friend told me to stop cooking and buy back my time. So I ordered food. Same friend told me to get a cleaner. I did that too.</p>
    <p>My social life became minimal. Weddings and birthdays and even then, I left early. Eventually, I sent a mass message: “See you in six months. I’m studying.”</p>
    <p>Some mates didn’t believe how much time I spent coding. So I started sending selfies. One each day. Shirtless, at my desk, mid-code. Eventually, I turned it into a reel. That’s when I realised: I code shirtless more often than I should. Not professional. Definitely not LinkedIn friendly. But it’s a thing. Still send them when people ask what I’m doing on weekends. Trying to keep a shirt on these days. Trying. But people say red cars go faster, and maybe I code better that way. Bad habits die hard.</p>

    <h2>Projects I Built</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>First Website</strong>: Finished on Christmas Eve. It looks like it was built in 1997. It wasn’t. But I’m proud of it.
        <a href="https://gysohn-v1.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Site</a> |
        <a href="https://github.com/gysagsohn/gysohn_T1A2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Python Terminal App</strong>: A truck register inspired by work.
        <a href="https://github.com/gysagsohn/T1A3---Terminal-Application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rowing Tracker (Python + PostgreSQL)</strong>: API-based tracker for a rowing coach mate.
        <a href="https://github.com/gysagsohn/T2A2-API-rowing_db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Final Major Project (MERN)</strong>: A whiteboard scheduler for my workplace. It worked, even if it wasn’t pretty.
        <a href="https://github.com/gysagsohn/t3a2_whiteboard_frontend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frontend</a> |
        <a href="https://github.com/gysagsohn/T3A2B_whiteboardscheduler_backend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backend</a>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Fun Fails and Fixes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Named a folder “SRC” instead of “src”. Git was fine. Netlify was not.</li>
      <li>Invisible space in a filename. Debugged for hours.</li>
      <li>Cloned the wrong repo. Thought I’d written someone else’s app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moral: check everything. Then check it again.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t all coffee and crashes, sometimes things just worked, and that felt like magic.</p>
    <p>Seeing something I worked on being used in real life, something I could click around in and interact with, was amazing. I still love it. The irony isn’t lost on me I worked as a solicitor in non corporate areas, helping real people (criminal law is still my great love, even if I won’t go back to it), and then moved into construction. Both meaningful in their own ways. But there’s something to coding working on a problem, building something, and seeing it come together on screen. Great feeling.</p>

    <h2>What I Loved</h2>
    <p>Not everything was a grind. There were plenty of lightbulb moments the first time I built a working API, or when I had a lot of issues with Git early on and realised halfway through the course that Git problems didn’t scare me anymore.</p>
    <p>Or when a complex layout finally looked right in mobile view though let's be honest, working with mobile views is still annoying. Who even has a phone narrower than 350 pixels? Plenty, apparently.</p>
    <p>I made great connections with a few classmates, and while none of them live in the same city, I’ve really enjoyed keeping in touch. Those relationships made a big difference, especially in an online only environment.</p>
    <p>I surprised myself with how far I came, not just based on what others told me, but from what I could see for myself like looking back at my first portfolio site and realising how much I’ve grown.</p>
    <p>There’s a strange thrill when you see how all your code comes together to make something real. Or when you hit a “Eureka” moment, and everything you’ve studied suddenly clicks especially during those late stage coding challenges, when you realise you’ve used some basic algorithm or logical structure without even thinking about it. That was a rush.</p>

    <h2>What I’d Do Differently</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Build from day one</li>
      <li>Finish every coding challenge</li>
      <li>Network early, even if I felt unready</li>
      <li>Connect more with fellow students fully online was tough, and I didn’t lean in enough</li>
      <li>Care more about UI and UX presentation matters</li>
      <li>Use tools earlier: Figma, Coolors, Netlify, Canva, Obsidian, ResponsivelyApp</li>
      <li>Trello changed my life. I now use it for everything: work, life, shopping, health insurance. Should’ve used it during assignments</li>
      <li>Ask more questions, sooner</li>
      <li>Celebrate small wins. I didn’t. I should have.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Champagne Bottles</h2>
    <p>I bought two bottles of champagne. One for finishing. One for getting a job.</p>
    <p>The first is still unopened. Not because I didn’t finish but because I never stopped to celebrate. There was always something else to do. Another challenge. Another submission. Another bug. The second? Still chilling.</p>
    <p>I should’ve paused. I should’ve taken a moment.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>This bootcamp changed how I learn, work, and manage time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It will take everything</li>
      <li>Apply early</li>
      <li>Network early</li>
      <li>Pick a course that suits your life</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To my fellow students and the educators who made this possible thank you. You made it less lonely, more human, and absolutely worth it.</p>
