    <h2>Why I Signed Up</h2>
    <p>After nearly a decade in law and construction, I wanted something different. I needed flexibility, intellectual challenge, and a future-friendly career. Tech ticked all the boxes. I’d already started dabbling with CS50 and realised software engineering could be the leap I was looking for. I enrolled in Coder Academy with a plan, a full-time job, and just enough confidence to think I could do both.</p>

    <h2>The Course</h2>
    <p>I studied with the Academy of Interactive Technology Pty Ltd (trading as Coder Academy Australia), graduating with a Diploma of Information Technology. It ran full-time across 10–12 months, starting in October 2023 and finishing with a 3-month internship at Go Driving.</p>
    <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Term 1: HTML, CSS, Git, Markdown, Python, basic computer science</li>
      <li>Term 2: Python, SQL, databases, logic, algorithms, number systems</li>
      <li>Term 3: JavaScript, MERN stack, final project</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tue & Thu: 7–9pm</li>
      <li>Sat: 9am–1:30pm</li>
      <li>Plus 13 hours of self-study weekly (not including assignments)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reality vs Expectation</h2>
    <p><strong>My original plan:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work full-time and study part-time, then switch to full-time study in the last 3 months</li>
      <li>Use CS50 to get ahead</li>
      <li>Network early</li>
      <li>Keep my social life and sleep intact</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What actually happened:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I thought I could keep up with the workload — but I couldn’t</li>
      <li>I needed all 13+ hours of study, and then some</li>
      <li>Social life vanished</li>
      <li>Crammed often, even when I started assignments early</li>
      <li>Burnout hit early, and I had to fight it with structure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rules I Had to Make to Survive</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Step away from bugs if I couldn’t fix them in under an hour</li>
      <li>No new code problems if I only had an hour left in the day</li>
      <li>Absolutely no coding puzzles before bed</li>
      <li>Ask questions</li>
      <li>Work off a plan — and stop when the time ran out</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also kept exercising, seeing people briefly, and meditating every night — 10 minutes without fail.</p>

    <h2>Life Adjustments I Made</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stopped cooking. Ordered meals instead</li>
      <li>Got a cleaner every two weeks</li>
      <li>Cut social life to survival mode</li>
      <li>Sent a blanket message: “See you in six months. I’m studying.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also started sending mid-study selfies to mates — unintentionally creating a shirtless photo collection I’ll never release.</p>

    <h2>Projects I Built</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>First Website</strong>: Looks like the 90s. Chaotic colour choices. But it’s a badge of honour. [Live | GitHub]</li>
      <li><strong>Python Terminal App</strong>: A truck register inspired by my job. First time I saw how code could solve real problems. [GitHub]</li>
      <li><strong>Rowing Tracker (Python + PostgreSQL)</strong>: API-driven app for a mate who’s a rowing coach. Still proud. [GitHub]</li>
      <li><strong>Final Major Project (MERN)</strong>: Full-stack whiteboard scheduler. Design missed the mark, but it worked. Still coming, Michael. [Frontend | Backend]</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Fun Fails & Fixes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"SRC" vs "src" — GitHub didn’t care, but Netlify threw a tantrum</li>
      <li>Invisible space in a file name — hours of debugging pain</li>
      <li>Wrong Git repo — thought I cloned mine, turns out it was someone else's</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Moral: triple-check everything. Then check again.</p>

    <h2>How I Got the Most Out of Class</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do the pre-reading</li>
      <li>Work on side projects (I wish I did more)</li>
      <li>Focus less on marks, more on weird ideas and learning by doing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflections & What I’d Do Differently</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Build more, earlier</li>
      <li>Do all the coding challenges on time</li>
      <li>Start networking from day one</li>
      <li>Explore tools like Figma, Coolors, Netlify, Obsidian, Canva, ChatGPT</li>
      <li>Spend time on UI/UX — your app doesn’t need awards, but it should be usable</li>
      <li>Ask more questions — ego got in the way too often</li>
      <li>Celebrate small wins (like remembering to eat)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, I bought two champagne bottles when I enrolled — one to open when I finished, one when I got a job. Neither’s been opened. I should’ve celebrated more along the way.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>This bootcamp reshaped how I work, manage time, and learn.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Know it’ll take everything</li>
      <li>Start applying for jobs from day one</li>
      <li>Network early — you’ll never feel “ready”</li>
      <li>Research and find a course that suits <em>you</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To my fellow students and amazing educators — thank you. You made it less lonely, more human, and way more doable.</p>
    <p>Yes, that second bottle is still chilling.</p>
