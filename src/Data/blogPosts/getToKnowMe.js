    <h2>Let’s break the fourth wall for a minute.</h2>

    <h3>Born in Korea, Raised Everywhere</h3>
    <p>Born in South Korea, 1990. Spent a few years in Canada and Fiji, but properly landed in Australia in the early 2000s after the Sydney Olympics, when Cathy Freeman was queen and the Harbour Bridge had a whole vibe going on.</p>

    <h3>Family</h3>
    <p>It’s Mum, Dad, my older brother (plus his awesome wife), and two very cute additions: one niece and one nephew. They all live back in Korea.</p>

    <h3>Northern Beaches or Bust</h3>
    <p>According to my parents, on our first drive down to Manly (probably Sydney Road), I looked out over the beach and said, “I’m going to live here forever.” Not much has changed.</p>

    <h3>Sports I’ve Played (and Mostly Survived)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Played rugby through high school (tighthead prop, obviously)</li>
      <li>Tried surfing. Never got good. Still love it.</li>
      <li>Decent swimmer, thanks Mum for those brutal 6am squad trainings.</li>
      <li>Boxing. Started at 27 when a friend dragged me to a free class. I fell in love instantly, got in the ring four months later, and never looked back. Five fights, a broken nose, one rib, coloured toenails, and no state title but plenty of stories.</li>
      <li>Rock climbing. Flirted with it briefly, did a few multipitch climbs in the Blue Mountains, got scared, bowed out. Respect to those who keep at it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instruments</h3>
    <p>There was a brief cello phase. Mum was a concert pianist. I was... not. But I played all through high school. Had to make the Asian parents proud.</p>

    <h3>Broken Bone Club</h3>
    <p>Fun fact: despite all the rough sports growing up, I never broke a bone. That streak ended in my late 20s with boxing. I like to think I earned it.</p>

    <h3>From Courtroom to Code</h3>
    <p>I became a solicitor on my birthday, 23/08/2015. My first case? A murder trial. Now I build web apps. Life’s weird. But the problem-solving, logic, and structure from law still comes in handy every day.</p>

    <h3>Outdoors Guy (Within Reason)</h3>
    <p>I love hiking and camping. But if it takes more than a day to get there and back, I’m out. I like nature, not survival simulations.</p>

    <h3>League of Legends (a.k.a. Digital Coping Mechanism)</h3>
    <p>Yes, I play LoL.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ADC main (Miss Fortune or Caitlyn)</li>
      <li>Top lane dabbler (Sion or spin-to-win Garen)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currently grinding to Bronze, slowly. Not going pro, but it's a great way to switch the brain off and yell at strangers.</p>

    <h3>Music Taste</h3>
    <p>Long-time fan of Red Hot Chili Peppers. They’ve topped my Spotify Wrapped more times than I’ll admit. Also big into EDM. Recently added country to the mix, influenced by a few American mates. No regrets.</p>

    <h3>Books & Reading Habits</h3>
    <p>Fantasy and sci-fi are my jam, but I’ll read anything. Law almost broke my love for reading, but I’ve rebuilt it. I aim to read at least one book a month and I’ve kept that up for the last few years.</p>

    <h3>Travel Vibes</h3>
    <p>Always scheming the next escape. Last big trip? Six weeks in Europe:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>London</li>
      <li>Lake District (UK)</li>
      <li>Cologne and Munich for Oktoberfest</li>
      <li>Lisbon</li>
      <li>A 10-day whirlwind bus trip around Switzerland with my parents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Nothing booked right now, but Canada in summer is calling. I want to see if I can out-bike a bear. (Kidding. Mostly.)</p>

    <h3>Food Quirks</h3>
    <p>I’ve been called a banana, yellow on the outside, white on the inside. But when it comes to food, I’m still very Korean. Love kimchi, Asian food, and spice. But I can cook anything. Word on the street is my prawn chilli linguine is to die for.</p>

    <h3>Coffee Preferences</h3>
    <p>My coffee order? Small soy cap with an extra shot. In summer, I’ll go for an iced long black or a cold drip. Every now and then, I’ll treat myself to a magic. It’s a Melbourne thing.</p>
