    <h2>The Early Days</h2>
    <p>I finished high school in 2007 with one certainty: I wanted to stay in Australia. My parents, on the other hand, were preparing to move back to South Korea. That meant figuring out what I wanted to do and fast. I had already been living away from them since 2008, and at that stage, I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to make this place my home.</p>
    <p>I loved history and philosophy. I was genuinely considering going down that path. But (cue classic Asian parent move), mine gently asked what I’d do after studying something like that. They never pressured me about what to study, but they did care that I did well. I wasn't a top student, but I was at the bottom of the top group, so to speak. I opened the uni guide, circled a few courses that sounded like they led to jobs (read: money), and landed on business and engineering. I got into Business at UTS and started in 2008.</p>

    <h2>From Business to Law</h2>
    <p>It was fine. I liked statistics, but back then, data science wasn't a thing. I flirted with the idea of accounting, but in the end picked management because it was easy. But I also found the degree too easy. So in 2009, I applied for the double degree: Business and Law at UTS.</p>
    <p>Law hit different. It was hard. I didn't love it, at least not at first. The debates, jurisprudence, the philosophy of law were not my thing. But it made my parents proud, and I liked the challenge. It wasn’t until my Practical Legal Training (PLT) in my final year that I really connected with law. I fell in love with it. Committed. And pushed through.</p>

    <h2>Life as a Solicitor</h2>
    <p>I graduated and became a Solicitor (we call them that in NSW). I worked in criminal law (my first and great love), then family law, and later immigration. On paper, it was a good run. But the stress, the long hours, the pressure of billing, managing clients, and leading a team (many older than me) started to take a toll. I didn’t admit it at the time. I told people I wanted a new challenge. But in hindsight, I was young, underpaid, and overworked.</p>

    <h2>Enter: Construction</h2>
    <p>Around that time, a friend (GM of a construction company called NDEA) was hiring a compliance manager. I was ready for a break and wanted new experience, so I applied. He ended up moving to the UK just as I joined, and the founder stepped back in. After a few months, the founder asked me to take over as GM. Wild. But between law firm management, billing, and leading teams, I wasn’t as unqualified as it sounds.</p>
    <p>Steep learning curve. Big shift. I went from managing lawyers to managing Vac Truck Operators. But I told myself I’d take 12 months out of law, try something new, then decide. And honestly, it hit me: law was fulfilling, but it was all-consuming. The billable hours meant long hours. And as much as I loved law, I didn’t want work to be everything. Also, family law gave me literal nightmares.</p>
    <p>I joined NDEA in 2019, age 29, firmly convinced I’d never marry. Working in family law will do that to you. Fast forward to today, and I’m looking forward to finding a partner and building something long-term.</p>

    <h2>Rethinking the Path</h2>
    <p>From 2020, I started looking at other career options. Engineering was on the table. The more I experienced the industry, the more I realised it just wasn’t for me. I didn’t feel a strong connection to the work or the long-term culture, and I knew I wanted to explore something different. I also didn’t want to go back to uni for another three to four years.</p>
    <p>Then came COVID. Everything went on pause. I was grateful just to have a job. But by the end of 2020, the search restarted. I did career counselling, spoke to people, explored options. Then something happened that really made things click.</p>
    <p>A close friend (we’ll call her E) lost her mother. E was from Europe, and COVID meant she couldn’t visit her mum during treatment. She managed to arrive just as her mum entered palliative care. After the funeral, she stayed six months to support her dad and sort things out. And she could, because her job in tech marketing was fully remote.</p>
    <p>That hit me. My parents live overseas. If something happened to them, neither law nor construction would let me leave Sydney for months. I needed a job that was remote-friendly. This isn’t something I need right now my parents are in their 60s and I’m hopeful that won’t become urgent for at least 10 more years but it’s something I want to be ready for.</p>

    <h2>Why Tech Made Sense</h2>
    <p>So I made a checklist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Must allow remote work</li>
      <li>Must offer intellectual challenge (I missed that from law)</li>
      <li>Must be a growing industry</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By late 2022, software engineering had moved to the top of the list. I read everything, spoke to everyone. The advice? Try a free online course. See if you like it.</p>
    <p>I tried a few, but nothing clicked until I found CS50. Halfway through, I was hooked. It ticked all the boxes. But I also realised something else: fully self-paced online learning wasn’t for me. I needed structure.</p>
    <p>I also noticed something else: tech wasn't the same as what I had read about years ago. By the end of COVID, it had become more competitive, harder to break into, and required real persistence. But I became a Solicitor at the tail end of the GFC, so I knew what that meant: outwork everyone else, and you'll get through.</p>
    <p>One line from a lecture stuck with me. They referenced Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The two are being chased, and it isn't until they take a path so difficult their pursuers won't follow that they finally escape. That metaphor stayed with me. I never fact-checked it. Never even saw the movie. But I still believe it.</p>

    <h2>Coder Academy and the Career Jump</h2>
    <p>Enter: Coder Academy.</p>
    <p>I chose Coder because it offered a nationally recognised Diploma. That meant government support, and a qualification I could build on if I chose to study further.</p>
    <p>I had a plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start October 2023</li>
      <li>Work full-time and study full-time for 6 months</li>
      <li>Quit job, study full-time and find part-time work for last 6 months</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But plans rarely survive contact with reality.</p>
    <p>In October 2023, NDEA was acquired by Ready Vac (now Ready Group). I was upfront with my new boss, Matt. Told him about the career change. He was incredibly supportive, asked if I could help with the transition for 3 to 6 months. I agreed.</p>
    <p>Spoiler: I still work at Ready Group two days a week. I've even built real-world coding projects they're using.</p>

    <h2>Life Now</h2>
    <p>I finished the course. The hours were long, the work was intense, and the growth was worth it. These days I work two days at Ready Group, and the rest of the week for myself, building projects under the highly unofficial banner of Gy and Co.</p>
    <p>If you're curious about what it was like doing a coding bootcamp while juggling life and work, keep an eye out for my upcoming blog on the Coder Academy experience.</p>

    <h2>Looking Back</h2>
    <p>My career path wasn't linear. It zigzagged from law to construction to code. Each chapter taught me something, and every step helped me become a better problem solver. Now, I get to build useful things, stay curious, and continue learning in a way that challenges and excites me.</p>
    <p>And if you're thinking about changing careers? You’re not too old, too late, or too behind. You just need a plan and maybe a good playlist to code to.</p>
