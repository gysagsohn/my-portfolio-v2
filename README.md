# Gy Sohn – Portfolio Website (v2)

Welcome to the version 2 of my personal developer portfolio website. This project is a ground-up rebuild focused on improving visual design, interactivity, and showcasing my growth as a full-stack developer.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this portfolio is to:
- Present my technical skills and personal projects.
- Share a short bio and my career transition journey.
- Create an interactive, well-designed digital space that reflects who I am as a developer.
- Optionally include a blog or insights section in the future.

## Design & Inspiration

This portfolio draws inspiration from several developer portfolios and templates, combining the best of each to reflect my own style:

- **[DeveloperFolio](https://developerfolio.js.org/)** – Functionality, React structure, and customisability.
- **[Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)** – Interactivity, playful design, and narrative-driven content.
- **[Brittany Chiang](https://v4.brittanychiang.com/)** – Layout structure and clean professional aesthetic.
- **[Harnish Design – Callum Template](https://harnishdesign.net/demo/react/callum/demo/)** – Full-screen menu, transitions, and skill display features.

## Tech Stack

Planned tools and technologies:
- **React (Vite or CRA)**
- **CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS**
- **React Router**
- **Netlify or Vercel** for deployment
- **Optional:** Animation libraries (Framer Motion / AOS), custom cursor, blog markdown setup

## Notes to Self

- Add credit line:  
  "Loosely designed in Figma and coded in Visual Studio Code by yours truly. Built with React and deployed with Netlify. Typeface: Inter."

- Save the retro link/TARDIS easter egg idea for version 2.1
- Consider blog posts as markdown or hardcoded components for now
